# -T20-World-Cup-2024-Data-Analysis-Dashboard
Developed an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze match outcomes, player performance, and team strategies. Incorporated DAX measures, geospatial analysis with OpenStreetMap APIs, and advanced filtering techniques to deliver real-time insights on winner runs, wickets, and toss decisions.

📊 Project Overview

This project presents an interactive Power BI dashboard built on the T20 World Cup 2024 dataset.
It provides real-time insights into team and player performance using data visualization, DAX measures, and geospatial analysis.

The dashboard helps cricket enthusiasts, analysts, and decision-makers explore:

Match statistics (average winner runs, wickets, toss decisions)

City-wise performance metrics mapped via OpenStreetMap APIs

Impact of toss decisions on match outcomes and winning probabilities

Player-level insights with cross-filtering and slicers

🚀 Key Features

Interactive Visualizations – Dynamic charts and KPIs for quick match insights.

Advanced Data Analysis with DAX – Used calculated columns & measures to analyze runs, wickets, and outcomes.

Geospatial Analysis – City-wise winner runs plotted on an interactive map (OpenStreetMap).

Correlation Insights – Toss decision vs winning probability, team strategies, and performance metrics.

User-Friendly Filtering – Cross-filtering, slicers, and drill-through functionality for deep exploration.
